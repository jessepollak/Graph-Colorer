#Test Cases

Currently, we have 5 test cases.

##empty.txt:

This is an empty graph with 6 nodes.

Optimal chromatic number: 1
Achieved chromatic number: 1

##line.txt:

This is a graph with 2 nodes and an edge between them

Optimal chromatic number: 2
Achieved chromatic number: 2

##tree.txt:

This is a tree with 10 nodes

Optimal chromatic number: 2
Achieved chromatic number: 2

##graph.txt:

This is the graph given in the problem description

Optimal chromatic number: 3
Achieved chromatic number: 3

##complete.txt:

This is a K5 complete graph

Optimal chromatic number: 5
Achieved chromatic number: 5

Judging by these results, I would say that the algorithm does well; although, it would need more extensive testing to see if its greatness held up in bigger graphs (I doubt it does).
