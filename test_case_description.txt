Currently, we have 4 test cases.

empty.txt:

This is an empty graph with 6 nodes.

Optimal number of colors: 1
Achieved number of colors: 1

line.txt:

This is a graph with 2 nodes and an edge between them

Optimal number of colors: 2
Achieved number of colors: 2

tree.txt:

This is a tree with 10 nodes

Optimal number of colors: 2
Achieved number of colors: 2

graph.txt:

This is the graph given in the problem description

Optimal number of colors: 3
Achieved number of colors: 3

Judging by these results, I would say that the algorithm does well; although, it would need more extensive testing to see if its greatness held up in bigger graphs (I doubt it does).
